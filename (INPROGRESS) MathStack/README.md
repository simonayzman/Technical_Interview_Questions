### Math Stack

Implement a class called `MathStack` that allows for certain operations. It must be able to push, pop, and find the minimum element.

You may ONLY use stacks to complete this project (no other data structures, such as vectors or lists, are allowed). Moreover, the input stack MUST remain unchanged from its original state after the function returns; in other words, the stack has the same values in the same order after the function has completed.
