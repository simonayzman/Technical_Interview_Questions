### Fizz Buzz

Write a function that cycles through the integers between 1 and n, inclusive.
If the integer is divisible by 3, output "Fizz" on its own line.
If the integer is divisible by 5, output "Buzz" on its own line.
If the integer is divisible by both, output "FizzBuzz" on its own line.
If the integer is divisible by neither, output the integer itself on its own line.

For example, cycling between 1 and 16 produces the following output (condensed to fit on one line):

    1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16

Use the following function declaration:

    void fizzBuzz(int n);
