### Linked List Reversal

Implement a function that reverses a singly linked list. For example:

    // Before reversal
    2 -> 15 -> 6 -> 1 -> [NULL]

    // After reversal
    1 -> 6 -> 15 -> 2 -> [NULL]

Assume that you are implementing a member function of a LinkedList class, where you have access to the private instance variable `head`. There is no instance variable that holds the size. You must modify the data structure, not return a copy. Use the following function declaration:

    void reverse();
